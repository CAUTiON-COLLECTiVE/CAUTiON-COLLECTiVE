please don't interact if your an endogenic system, we don't support or agree with your choices, however we don't/wont harass edo's either.

we have a hard time trusting and becoming friends with people, so please be patient :)

we block freely, and wont hesitate to cut you off if we feel unsafe or uncomfortable.

just because we don't individually use we/us constantly (we interchange i/me and we/us, doesn't mean our system is fake. each headmate is an individual.
